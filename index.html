    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      I<span id="footnote-1"></span> am a Computer Science Lecturer (roughly equivalent to a US Assistant Professor) at
      the <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&australasia">University of Sydney</a>. I co-founded
      <a href="https://d23e.ch">D23E.ch</a> with Professor Arthur Gervais (UCL) and Dr Kaihua Qin (Yale).<br /><br />

      My focus is on security and privacy issues, with the ultimate goal of developing generalized AI in system/software
      security to identify vulnerabilities, much like how Noam Brown created the first Poker AI. While my research spans
      beyond
      blockchain, I find it particularly engaging as a testbed due to its vast amount of open code and bytecode,
      transparent data
      from <a
        href="https://www.nansen.ai/guides/defi-statistics-in-2022#:~:text=Unique%20DeFi%20users%20have%20risen,to%20more%20than%206.5%20million.">millions
        of users and bots</a>, and <a href="">real-world attacks involving billions of USD</a><span
        id="footnote-2"></span>. Don't let the term "blockchain" mislead you though - my research in this space directly
      advances
      general system/software security principles.

        <h2>I am Hiring!</h2>

        I am actively looking for PhD students to join my research group at the University of Sydney. My primary vision
        is to
        develop the next generation of AI security agents - systems that can autonomously identify, analyze, and prevent
        security vulnerabilities, similar to how AI has revolutionized games like Poker.

        My research interests span across:
        <ul>
          <li>AI-powered security agents for vulnerability detection and prevention</li>
          <li>Large security models - using LLMs to enhance existing security tools</li>
          <li>Real-time intrusion detection and prevention ðŸ””</li>
          <li>Advanced program analysis (fuzzing, symbolic execution)</li>
          <li>Privacy-preserving transaction systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>PhD Candidates ðŸŽ“</h5>

          <p>
            Liyi is a researcher specialized in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Over the past five years, he
            has published extensively in leading international security conferences, and his work has been widely cited.
            His research mainly focuses on developing innovative ways to detect software vulnerabilities automatically,
            particularly by using advanced machine learning techniques. Liyi has built several practical, effective
            systems to identify security threats and anomalies in software. He has hands-on experience includes finding
            critical software vulnerabilities, which earned him multiple awards from bug bounty programs. He
            collaborates
            with top international researchers from universities like UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich, helping to extend the
            real-world impact and visibility of his research.
            <br><br>

            Liyi's current focus is about creating intelligent software tools that can independently identify and
            exploit
            software vulnerabilities without needing constant human supervision. His work introduces new ways for AI
            systems to reason about complex security issues on their own, adapting dynamically to emerging threats and
            iteratively refining their strategies. Using real-world data, especially from blockchain security incidents,
            Liyi's approach advances current cybersecurity methods through reinforcement learning, automated reasoning,
            and focused fine-tuning techniques. This research fills an important gap in existing technologies, moving
            cybersecurity systems from simple pattern matching towards more genuine, strategic problem-solving
            abilities.
            The goal is to significantly improve accuracy and reliability of automated cybersecurity solutions.
            <br><br>

            Liyi's research is valuable because it creates tools that can automatically identify software
            vulnerabilities,
            preventing dangerous exploits. These innovations can greatly benefit academic researchers, industries,
            governments, and broader society by reducing the need for costly and slow manual security reviews. Liyi's
            work
            aligns with Australia's national cybersecurity priorities, helping build local expertise in security
            technologies. Through mentoring and training the next generation of cybersecurity experts and through strong
            international collaborations, Liyi contributes to strengthening national cybersecurity capabilities.
            Additionally, insights from his research will shape responsible public policies around artificial
            intelligence, protecting important digital infrastructure and enhancing public trust in technology.
            <br><br>

            Liyi has demonstrated success previously by integrating artificial intelligence effectively with
            cybersecurity, shown clearly through practical prototypes and research projects he has completed. He
            receives
            strong support from the University of Sydney, including access to advanced computing equipment, funding
            resources, and expert collaborators in relevant fields. His project strategy focuses on adapting existing
            machine learning technologies and using cloud infrastructure to ensure his methods are practical and
            scalable.
            Initial experiments and prototype systems have already shown promising results, confirming the feasibility
            and
            potential of his approach.
