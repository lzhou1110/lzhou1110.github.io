    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I<span id="footnote-1"></span> am a Computer Science Lecturer (roughly equivalent to a US Assistant Professor) at the <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&australasia">University of Sydney</a>, and the co-founder of <a href="https://d23e.ch">D23E.ch</a>. I focus on security and privacy problems. I work closely with Professor Arthur Gervais and Dr Kaihua Qin.<span id="footnote-2"></span><br/><br/>

        A significant part of my work focuses on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) due to their abundant data (code, transactions, attacks) and transparency. With a high Total Value Locked (TVL~$96 billion), research in this area has a substantial impact.<br/><br/>

        My ultimate goal is to develop generalized AI in security, similar to how Noam Brown created the first Poker AI.<br/><br/>

PhD is an educational journey, offering a unique opportunity to focus exclusively on your research without distractions.'
