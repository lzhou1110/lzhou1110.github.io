I am supervised by Professor Arthur Gervais, who is currently affiliated with University College London (UCL).
I decided to pursue my PhD with Professor Gervais mainly because of his renowned work on
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf">the security and performance of proof of work blockchains</a>
 - currently ranked 72nd in
<a href="https://www.mlsec.org/topnotch/sec_top100.html">the top 100 most influential security papers</a>.

I am also fortunate to have the opportunity to collaborate with Kaihua on a number of research papers.
Kaihua is an expert in decentralised technology and has made significant contributions to the field.
Working with Kaihua has been a great learning experience, and one of our papers,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05511">"the dark forest"</a>,
is currently ranked 17th in
<a href="https://www.mlsec.org/topnotch/sec_ntop100.html">the top 100 most influential security papers normalized by age</a>.

        </span>.
        My research focuses on
        decentralised technology security, including Blockchain

        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle"/>

Mainly EVM compatibale blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain)
        </span>
        and Decentralised Finance (DeFi). My goal is to increase our understanding of these areas and make meaningful
        contributions to their development.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left;">As I near the completion of my PhD, I am actively seeking tenure-track positions in
        academia. On this website, you can find more information about my education, skills, and experience. If you are
        interested in collaborating on research or have any other inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank

        DeFi Security - Attacks

According to our data, users, liquidity providers, speculators, and protocol operators suffered a total loss of at least 3.24 billion USD from Apr 30, 2018 to Apr 30, 2022.
<br><br>
We study attacks on DeFi to understand the nature and impact of these incidents, and to learn how to strengthen the security of DeFi systems.
By analyzing past attacks, we can identify patterns, predict future attacks, and prevent losses.

        DeFi Security - MEV/BEV
        <label for="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">
MEV (Miner/Maximum Extracted Value) and BEV (Blockchain Extracted Value) refer to any value that is extracted or extractable from a blockchain through the actions of miners or other blockchain participants. It can be challenging to determine whether a particular MEV/BEV opportunity is an attack or not, as there are instances where MEV/BEV opportunities are not attacks (e.g., arbitrage) and instances where attacks are not MEV/BEV (e.g., compromise of a wallet private key). In other words, MEV/BEV and attacks are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
<br>
<br>
MEV/BEV risks refer to the potential for miners or other blockchain participants to extract value from a blockchain in a way that may compromise the security and integrity of the network. This can include front-running, where a miner takes advantage of advanced knowledge of a pending transaction or order to execute a trade that profits from that knowledge, and reorg attacks, where the history of a blockchain is altered by replacing a portion of the chain with a different set of blocks. Both of these risks can lead to losses for traders and users who rely on the integrity of the blockchain for their transactions, and can be difficult to detect and prevent. To mitigate these risks, it is important for DeFi systems to have strong security measures in place, such as robust consensus algorithms and effective measures for detecting and preventing malicious activity.
