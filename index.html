    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I<span id="footnote-1"></span> am a Computer Science Lecturer (roughly equivalent to a US Assistant Professor) at the <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&australasia">University of Sydney</a>. I co-founded <a href="https://d23e.ch">D23E.ch</a><span id="footnote-2"></span>.<br/><br/>

        My focus is on security and privacy issues, with the ultimate goal of developing generalized AI in system/software security to identify vulnerabilities, much like how Noam Brown created the first Poker AI. While I am not limited to blockchain, I find it particularly engaging due to its vast amount of open code and bytecode, transparent data from <a href="https://www.nansen.ai/guides/defi-statistics-in-2022#:~:text=Unique%20DeFi%20users%20have%20risen,to%20more%20than%206.5%20million.">millions of users and bots</a>, and <a href="">real-world attacks involving billions of USD</a><span id="footnote-3"></span>. Don't get tricked by the term "blockchain" though. My research in blockchain aligns closely with general system/software security, despite the specialized name.
