Liyi is a researcher specialized in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Over the past five years, he has published extensively in leading international security conferences, and his work has been widely cited. His research mainly focuses on developing innovative ways to detect software vulnerabilities automatically, particularly by using advanced machine learning techniques. Liyi has built several practical, effective systems to identify security threats and anomalies in software. He has hands-on experience includes finding critical software vulnerabilities, which earned him multiple awards from bug bounty programs. He collaborates with top international researchers from universities like UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich, helping to extend the real-world impact and visibility of his research.

Liyi's current focus is about creating intelligent software tools that can independently identify and exploit software vulnerabilities without needing constant human supervision. His work introduces new ways for AI systems to reason about complex security issues on their own, adapting dynamically to emerging threats and iteratively refining their strategies. Using real-world data, especially from blockchain security incidents, Liyi’s approach advances current cybersecurity methods through reinforcement learning, automated reasoning, and focused fine-tuning techniques. This research fills an important gap in existing technologies, moving cybersecurity systems from simple pattern matching towards more genuine, strategic problem-solving abilities. The goal is to significantly improve accuracy and reliability of automated cybersecurity solutions.

Liyi’s research is valuable because it creates tools that can automatically identify software vulnerabilities, preventing dangerous exploits. These innovations can greatly benefit academic researchers, industries, governments, and broader society by reducing the need for costly and slow manual security reviews. Liyi's work aligns with Australia's national cybersecurity priorities, helping build local expertise in security technologies. Through mentoring and training the next generation of cybersecurity experts and through strong international collaborations, Liyi contributes to strengthening national cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, insights from his research will shape responsible public policies around artificial intelligence, protecting important digital infrastructure and enhancing public trust in technology.

Liyi has demonstrated success previously by integrating artificial intelligence effectively with cybersecurity, shown clearly through practical prototypes and research projects he has completed. He receives strong support from the University of Sydney, including access to advanced computing equipment, funding resources, and expert collaborators in relevant fields. His project strategy focuses on adapting existing machine learning technologies and using cloud infrastructure to ensure his methods are practical and scalable. Initial experiments and prototype systems have already shown promising results, confirming the feasibility and potential of his approach.
